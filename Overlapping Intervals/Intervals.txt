This pattern describes an efficient technique to deal with OVERLAPPING INTERVALS. In a lot of 
problems involving intervals, we either need to 
(i)find overlapping intervals OR (ii) merge intervals if they overlap

Given two intervals 'a' and 'b', there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate 
to each other:
1. 'a' and 'b' DO NOT OVERLAP, ie they're MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE intervals 'a' is followed by 'b'
2. 'a' and 'b' DO NOT OVERLAP, ie they're MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE intervals 'b' is followed by 'a'
3. 'a' and 'b' OVERLAP, 'b' ends after 'a'
4. 'a' and 'b' OVERLAP, 'a' ends after 'b'
5. 'a' COMPLETELY OVERLAPS 'b'.
6. 'b' COMPLETELY OVERLAPS 'a'.

Understanding the above six cases will help us in solving ALL intervals related problems. Letâ€™s 
jump onto our first problem to understand the Merge Interval pattern.
